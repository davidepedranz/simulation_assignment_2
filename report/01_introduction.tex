\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\ac{DES} is a powerful and widely used technique to analyze, compare and evaluate the performances of a system.
Performance evaluation is fundamental to take the right decisions in the design and construction of a system and guarantee that it behaves as expected.  

In this assignment, we will start from a Python simulator for the Aloha \ac{MAC} protocol to implement some variations of it.
We will briefly discuss the standard behaviour of Aloha and how the protocol is implemented in the original simulator.
We will introduce, one at a time, the modifications to the protocol and describe the respective implementations.
Finally, we will compare their performances using the results of the simulations.
