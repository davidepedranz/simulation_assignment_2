\section{Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}

\subsection{Offered load}
The total offered load is computed as the sum of the offered load from all stations, expressed in $Mbps$.
Formally, we have:

\begin{equation}
    load \, [Mbps] = \sum_{\substack{s \in stations \\ p \in packets(s)}} \frac{size(p)}{1024 ^ 2},
    \label{eq:throughput_raw}
\end{equation}

where $packets(s)$ denotes the packets generated by station $s$ and $size(p)$ is the dimension of packet $p$ in $byte$.
Since we know the distribution of packet arrivals and the distribution for the sizes of packets

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{gathered}
        size(p) \sim Unif(32, 1460), \\
        interarrival \,\, time \sim Exp(\lambda),
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}

and for each simulation we have a big number of generated packets, we can simplify \cref{eq:throughput_raw} to the following formula:

\begin{equation*}
    load \, [Mbps] = \lambda |stations| \frac{32+1460}{2} \frac{8}{1024 ^ 2},
\end{equation*}

which allows a more efficient computation of the metrics.


\subsection{Throughput}
The throughput at the receiver is defined as the amount of correctly received information over the simulation time:

\begin{equation}
    throughput \, [Mbps] = \frac{\sum_{p \in correct\_packets} size(p) \frac{8}{1024^2}}{simulation\_time} .
\end{equation}


\subsection{Collision Rate}
The collision rate measure the amount of packets that do not reach correctly the destination due to collisions on the channel:

\begin{equation}
    collision\_rate = \frac{|corrupted|}{|transmitted|},
\end{equation}

where $corrupted$ indicate the set of packets which where corrupted due to collisions and $transmitted$ denote the set of all sent packets.


\subsection{Packet Drop Rate}
The drop rate measure the amount of packets that where discarded by the stations because the queue of packets to transmit was already full.
Formally:

\begin{equation}
    drop\_rate = \frac{|dropped|}{|generated|},
\end{equation}

where $dropped$ is the set of packets dropped by a station and $generated$ denote the set of packets generated.
Note that $generated$ is different from $transmitted$, since the first includes also the packets dropped without sending them.


\subsection{Channel Corruption Rate}
The channel corruption rate measure the amount of packets that are corrupted by the channel before reaching the destination. Collisions are not considered for this metric.
We define the channel corruption rate as:

\begin{equation}
    corruption\_rate = \frac{|corrupted|}{|generated|},
\end{equation}

where $corrupted$ is the set of packets corrupted by the channel and $generated$ denote the set of packets generated.
