\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:simulation}

The simulator models the interarrival time between packets to transmit to a station with an exponential distribution.
The size of each packet is extracted from a uniform distribution between $32$ and $1460 B$.
Each station has a limited amount of memory, so it can store at most $2$ packets in a queue.
Packets that do not fit in the queue are discarded.
All simulations use the same network topology, shown in \cref{fig:network}.
Each simulation is run with multiple seeds for the pseudonumber generator in order to get more robust results.
